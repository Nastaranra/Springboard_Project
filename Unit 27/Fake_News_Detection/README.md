Fake News Detection
Overview
The topic of fake news detection on social media has recently attracted tremendous attention. The basic countermeasure of comparing websites against a list of labeled fake news sources is inflexible, and so a machine learning approach is desirable. Our project aims to use Natural Language Processing to detect fake news directly, based on the text content of news articles.
