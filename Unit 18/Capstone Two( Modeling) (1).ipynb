Methods such as Local outlier factor and isolation forest algorithm was used to calculate the anomaly scores. These algorithms use a dataset of slightly under 30000 credit card transactions to predict a fradualent transaction.\n",

    "What is Anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, called outliers. It has many applications in business, from intrusion detection (identifying strange patterns in network traffic that could signal a hack) to system health monitoring (spotting a malignant tumor in an MRI scan), and from fraud detection in credit card transactions to fault detection in operating environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomalies can be broadly categorized as: Point anomalies: A single instance of data is anomalous if it's too far off from the rest. Business use case- Detecting credit card fraud based on \"amount spent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual anomalies: The abnormality is context specific. This type of anomaly is common in time-series data. Business use case- Spending $100 on food every day during the holiday season is normal, but may be odd otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collective anomalies: A set of data instances collectively helps in detecting anomalies. Business use case- Someone is trying to copy data form a remote machine to a local host unexpectedly, an anomaly that would be flagged as a potential cyber attack."

    "What is Local Outlier Factor algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "LOF algorithm is an unsupervised outlier detection method which computes the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. It considers as outlier samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of neighbors considered, (parameter n_neighbors) is typically chosen 1) greater than the minimum number of objects a cluster has to contain, so that other objects can be local outliers relative to this cluster, and 2) smaller than the maximum number of close by objects that can potentially be local outliers. In practice, such informations are generally not available, and taking n_neighbors=20 appears to work well in general."

    "What is Isolation forest algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation Forest explicitly identifies anomalies instead of profiling normal data points. Isolation Forest, like any tree ensemble method, is built on the basis of decision trees. In these trees, partitions are created by first randomly selecting a feature and then selecting a random split value between the minimum and maximum value of the selected feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, outliers are less frequent than regular observations and are different from them in terms of values (they lie further away from the regular observations in the feature space). That is why by using such random partitioning they should be identified closer to the root of the tree (shorter average path length, i.e., the number of edges an observation must pass in the tree going from the root to the terminal node), with fewer splits necessary."
